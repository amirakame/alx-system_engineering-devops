Title: Postmortem - Outage Incident on 2023-11-01

Issue Summary:

Duration: November 1, 2023, from 14:00 to 16:30 (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a 2.5-hour downtime, resulting in a complete unavailability of the service. All users were affected during this time.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by an unexpected spike in traffic to the application, which led to a system resource exhaustion and ultimately a server crash.
Timeline:

14:00 UTC: Issue detected by an engineer who received multiple customer complaints about the application being unresponsive.
14:05 UTC: The engineering team initiated a full investigation into the issue.
14:20 UTC: Assumed the root cause to be a potential server overload.
14:45 UTC: Escalated the incident to the DevOps team for assistance.
15:00 UTC: DevOps team joined the investigation to assess server health and configurations.
15:30 UTC: Confirmed the root cause as resource exhaustion due to high traffic.
16:00 UTC: Issue resolved, and the application was back online.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a sudden influx of user traffic that exceeded the server's capacity. The application's auto-scaling mechanisms were not set up to handle such a rapid increase in concurrent connections. This led to high CPU and memory utilization, resulting in the server becoming unresponsive.

The issue was resolved by:

Scaling up the server capacity to handle the increased traffic load.
Implementing rate limiting and load balancing to distribute incoming requests evenly.
Fine-tuning the auto-scaling parameters to react faster to traffic spikes.
Adding additional monitoring and alerting to detect resource exhaustion early.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents in the future:

Implement proper load testing to ensure the application can handle anticipated traffic increases.
Set up more aggressive auto-scaling rules to react quickly to sudden traffic spikes.
Regularly review and adjust rate limiting and load balancing configurations.
Enhance monitoring and alerting for resource utilization and application responsiveness.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct a thorough review of the application's traffic patterns and ensure proper capacity planning.
Set up automated load testing to simulate traffic spikes and ensure the infrastructure can handle them.
Develop and implement automated scaling policies to handle traffic fluctuations effectively.
Establish a proactive monitoring system to alert the team of potential resource exhaustion in real-time.
This postmortem highlights the importance of anticipating traffic fluctuations and having robust auto-scaling mechanisms in place to handle unexpected load increases. It also emphasizes the need for proactive monitoring and quick incident response to minimize downtime and user impact.
